# Brainstorming

- Could download the file that describes the ratio of cases with that mutation (715 genes) for many different cancer types. Then each cancer type is its own point in the PCA with 715 dimensional data. We can then plot these and compare cancer types and see how closley related different cancer types are from eachother in terms of mutation rates.

#####

NN trained on RNA to predict most likely for each variable. Will there be enough data?

## NN

- Could train a NN to predict some characterstic from that cohort? Need to browse the website to see if there is any predictors.

Age: Can you predict age or other demographic info from mutation ratios of a type of cancer? If some mutations are more likely in older people, maybe we can predict that this type of cancer is more common in older people?

Survival: I beleive there is a survival column in teh downloadable file, no clue how it is populated
